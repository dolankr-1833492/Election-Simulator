# Election-Simulator
This program implements an ElectionSimulator class that can compute the minimum number of popular votes needed to win the Electoral College given the turnout during an election year. This is done assuming the simplifications that 
1. A simple majority of the popular votes in a state will win all of the stateâ€™s electors.
2. A majority of the electoral votes is needed to become president.
3. Electors never defect.
This is optomized using recursion and memoization. My code is ElectionSimulator.java
